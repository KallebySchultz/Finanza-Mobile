# Room Database Schema Mismatch Fix - Summary

## üîç Problem Identified

The Android app was crashing on startup with the following error:
```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Room cannot verify the data integrity. 
Looks like you've changed schema but forgot to update the version number. 
You can simply fix this by increasing the version number. 
Expected identity hash: 31d90180631d48846de0a9f2c026ab65, 
found: 62e39e3546d77a9a9fa0a6fd2adeb80d
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Database Version**: 
   - Incremented from version 5 to version 6 in `AppDatabase.java`

2. **Added New Migration**: 
   - Created `MIGRATION_5_6` to handle schema updates
   - Safely adds all sync-related columns to all tables
   - Uses try-catch to handle cases where columns might already exist
   - Creates necessary indexes for performance optimization

3. **Added Safety Fallback**:
   - Added `.fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` for development scenarios

4. **Verified Entity Compatibility**:
   - All entity models (Usuario, Conta, Categoria, Lancamento) have the required sync fields
   - Migration aligns with actual entity definitions

### Files Modified:
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/finanza/db/AppDatabase.java`
- `.gitignore` (to ignore temporary files)

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Clean Install Test
1. Completely uninstall the app from the device
2. Build and install the updated version
3. The app should start without crashing
4. Verify basic functionality (login, create account, etc.)

### Option 2: Upgrade Test  
1. If you have the previous version installed, build and install the new version
2. The migration should run automatically
3. Existing data should be preserved
4. Verify that sync fields are properly added to existing records

### Option 3: Database Verification
1. Use Android Studio's Database Inspector to examine the Room database
2. Check that all tables have the expected sync columns:
   - `uuid`, `lastModified`, `syncStatus`, `lastSyncTime`
   - Additional fields like `serverHash`, `isDeleted`, `serverId` where applicable

## üîß Build Instructions

```bash
# Clean and rebuild the project
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build

# Or for debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## üì± Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **App Startup**: No more Room database crashes
2. **Database Creation**: New installations create the schema correctly  
3. **Migration**: Existing installations upgrade seamlessly
4. **Sync Functionality**: Sync-related fields are available for the synchronization system
5. **Data Integrity**: All existing user data is preserved

## üö® If Problems Persist

If the app still crashes after this fix:

1. **Check Logcat** for any new error messages
2. **Clear App Data** in device settings to force a fresh database creation
3. **Verify Dependencies** - ensure Room version 2.6.1 is properly included
4. **Check Entity Annotations** - verify all @ColumnInfo annotations match the migration

## üìù Migration Details

The `MIGRATION_5_6` safely handles:
- Adding sync metadata columns to all tables
- Creating performance indexes
- Updating existing records with UUIDs and timestamps
- Using error handling to avoid crashes on duplicate column additions

This fix ensures the Room database schema matches exactly what the entity models expect, resolving the identity hash mismatch that was causing the crash.
